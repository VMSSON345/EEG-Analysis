    "TaskName": "Oddball",
    "TaskDescription": "In this paradigm, three stimuli (rare target — þ, rare distractor — Þ, frequent standard — p) were presented in a pseudorandom order with the restriction that two rare stimuli could not appear in a row. Participants were instructed to respond to the target stimulus (press key ‘2’ on numerical keyboard with right middle finger) and inhibit responses to other stimuli. The session contained 660 stimuli, which included approximately 12% targets, 12% deviant, and 76% standard stimuli. Task duration with breaks was set to ~22 min. Each stimulus was presented for 200 ms with an 1200-1600 ms ISI.",
